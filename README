This is a B/S application built to provide a place to make class exchangement for college student. I wrote this using PHP and javascript (Thanks jQuery which freed me from writing ajax function by my own. And sorry for I didn't use those really fantastic functions of it.).
This is just my assignment for the course on database. It is really a badly designed application, though I used to think about put it in use after the end of my course. However, time is limited and here it is. Feel free to extend my idea and build a real application on my bases or start over (Maybe the former one is more difficult...).
